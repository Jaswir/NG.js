NG.JS - An HTML5 port of the Newgrounds Flash API.
===

Right now, this library only supports Medals & Newgrounds Passport.
Which, fortunately, should cover a good 90% of all Newgrounds games.

**TODO:**

* A default Medal UI
* Highscores
* Saving/loading data

**Thanks to:**

* The Newgrounds Team, obviously!
